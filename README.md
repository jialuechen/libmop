# libmop
Libmop is a C++ library for model-based optimization, which implements algorithms including Bayesian optimization, kernels and likelihood maximization. It is highly customizable and can be used as state-of-the-art optimization library or to experiment with novel algorithms with plugin components. The implementation of libmop follows a policy-based designÂ that leverages C++ templates and can exploit multi-core computers and vectorize operations.
