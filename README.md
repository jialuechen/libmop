# Libmop
Libmop is a C++ library for model-based optimization, which implements algorithms including Bayesian optimization and kernel methods. It is highly customizable and can be used as state-of-the-art optimization library for hyper-parameter optimization. The implementation of libmop follows a policy-based designÂ that leverages C++ templates and can exploit multi-core computers and vectorize operations.
